## **Course description**

This course introduces participants to container orchestration with Kubernetes. Attendees will master the foundational concepts of Kubernetes in development and production through a
combination of presentations, demos, and hands-on labs, including building and deploying Kubernetes applications, cluster monitoring and debugging.

This course also covers system components, core resources, and the requirements for minimum viable cluster security.


## **Who should attend**

This course is designed for those who are new to Kubernetes and containers, as well as those who
have had exposure but would like to gain a deeper understanding. No prior knowledge of
Kubernetes is required. This course is suitable for developers, operations, architects and anyone
seeking to gain a strong foundation in modern, Cloud Native software delivery.
